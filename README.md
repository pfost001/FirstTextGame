# FirstTextGame
This is my first attempt at a text based game.
I did this project as an individual although I did consult peers when I had errors I couldn't resolve on my own. 
The goal of the game is fight enemies and get coins, use the coins to buy upgrades, then repeat.
Would like to adapt to a GUI once complete.
